## Background

The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business. As a result, they are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.

#### Time-Series Forecasting

Conclusions: Buy

* However, the risk is increasing; GARCH model has relatively higher confidence level.

#### Linear Regression Forecasting

Conclusions: 

* Out-of-Sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), 0.416, is less than In-sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), 0.566, so the model perform better than those that were observed for the trainning dataset.
